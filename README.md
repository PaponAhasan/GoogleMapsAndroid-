# GoogleMapsAndroid

Full-feature Android app using Google Maps API (integrate location) .This app will allow you to keep track of important places in your life.

We build an app which displays a map showing markers of important places. You can also create a map which gets saved to a file and can be retrieved when the app is opened. This app helps you keep track of places that matter to you, whether they’re vacation ideas or places you’ve lived.

The concepts we’ll cover: 
➤ Integrate map data with the Google Maps API 
➤ Navigate between screens with data (using intents)
➤ Persisting data into files
